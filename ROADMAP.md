# Alpha Roadmap / TODO List

## GENERAL

- [ ] Implement testing solution - one that will work best for various Frameworks.
- [ ] Consider Github Actions.
- [ ] Make Working branch the default. And/or protect master from being merged into from anywhere besides working.
- [ ] Template for making docs easier. And/or automation solution for docs.
- [ ] Map Pollen tokens to TW for easy and consistent generation.
- [ ] Add Colors to TW via Plugin.

## Theme Generator.

- Refine colors.
  - [ ] Add controls to fine tune color steps from the UI (IE, how far apart analogous steps are, change direction of color scheme).
  - [ ] Perhaps adjust colors visually as (possibly) mathematic solutions don't always work (IE some colors seem to dark in the triad color scheme). Research this.
  - [ ] Adjust range of random colors can be generated from. IE to avoid base colors that are too dark. Perhaps options for this.

## Tokens

- [ ] Space-x space-y token.
- [ ] Transition tokens.

## Components

- [ ] Stepper
- [ ] Star Ratings
- [ ] Progress
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Avatar
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] List Boxes
- [ ] File Dropzone
- [ ] Tables
