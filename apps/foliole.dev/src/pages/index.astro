				<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome to Foliole UI - Version Alpha!</h1>
				<p>This is an initial demo site for Foliole UI, a toolkit and library.</p>
				<p>
					The state of the project is as follows: there is an early prototype of a Theme Generator written in Svelte. There is basic branding and site design. I am in the process of preparing the foundational CSS and JavaScript framework implementations. The framework development is beginning in Vue (followed by Svelte and React). Also, I am making the project ready for group and open-source contributions.

								Foliole's CSS solution is built from Elements (CSS Classes for Buttons, Inputs, etc) and CSS Properties, and "Tokens", all of which are pared well with Tailwind, though Tailwind is not required.

							<span class="inline-block">
								Foliole is currently being developed for use with Vue and Svelte. Foliole will add additional Frameworks shortly after. Because the library is written to pass in css utility classes rather than individual prop options, we can reduce the need for framework specific prop logic. This makes it easier to develop for mulitple frameworks.
