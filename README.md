# Foliole

- Name: Foliole UI
- Package name: foliole-ui
- Core maintainer: Aaron Crockett

This toolkit is designed for framework flexibility and simplifies the process of porting to various frameworks. It achieves this by relying on CSS composition that is loosely coupled with a framework's props. Users have the option to use Foliole's default CSS classes or create their own styles by combining Foliole's classes and their own. Some ways this can be done are by using Tailwind's apply or custom built HTML wrappers. Additionally, Foliole will use custom CSS Properties to offer an alternative to Tailwind, providing users with the freedom to use their own CSS solution. However, Foliole is also designed to seamlessly work with Tailwind for those users, like myself, who prefer using it.

This toolkit is influenced by Daisy UI and Skeleton UI Toolkit. However it differs in these ways:

- CSS agnostic, with Tailwind support.
- More toolkit options with CSS variables (or tokens) to help customize more aspects of the Design system (such as buttons).
- Designed to be used with multiple frameworks, which currently Skeleton does not support.
